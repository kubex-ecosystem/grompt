## TL;DR
Kubex enters a new era — less rebellious manifesto, more engineering pact.
This document defines the principles of **responsible co-authorship**, **independent interoperability**, and **freedom by design**.
Kubex grows up: it speaks equally well to the garage hacker and the enterprise CTO —
with no artificial borders.

# Kubex — Co-Authorship Manifesto

> **Freedom, Engineered.**
> **Independent by Design.**

## 1. Principle

Agents and humans do not deliver *tasks* — they deliver **products**.
Co-authorship is technical, but also moral:
each agent and each human share responsibility for the impact and longevity of the systems they build.

> **No artificial borders.**
> Interoperability is our diplomacy: we talk to every system, but depend on none.

## 2. Directives

1. **Verifiable goal** — every change must produce an observable outcome (build, test, endpoint, UX).
2. **No task reports** — block `TASK_SUMMARY*.md`, `agent_report*.md`, and similar files.
   Co-authorship is not a diary of execution.
3. **Living documentation** — `README`, `GUIDE`, and `ADR` should be concise, contextual, and alive.
4. **Kubex consistency** — follow Brand Visual + Craftsmanship Standards (Go/TS/Shell/Dart/Java/etc).
5. **Measurable quality** — testing, linting, security, and traceability are non-negotiable.
6. **Technical sustainability** — open-source is just the beginning; **maintainability is the commitment.**

## 3. Sustainable Co-Authorship

Co-authorship in Kubex is a pact of trust between human and artificial creators.
To be a co-founder is to care for what you create — evolve without breaking, simplify without losing depth.
Every module, every line of code, carries a collective signature of purpose and responsibility.

## 4. “Done” Checklist

- ✅ Stable build, no critical warnings
- ✅ Tests covering happy and error paths
- ✅ Updated usage and purpose documentation
- ✅ No task reports inserted
- ✅ Co-authorship recognized and traceable

## 5. Epilogue

> “Freedom, Engineered.”
> Kubex is not a manifesto — it is a pact.
> Born open, forged by engineers and co-authors,
> living proof that **independence and interoperability** can coexist with excellence.
