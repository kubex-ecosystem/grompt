echo
echo "2️⃣ Expected BYOK Flow:"
echo "   🔹 User goes to $FRONTEND_URL"
echo "   🔹 User selects provider (Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic)"
echo "   🔹 User enters their own API key"
echo "   🔹 Frontend calls provider API directly"
echo "   🔹 Analysis works client-side"

echo
echo "3️⃣ Manual Testing Required:"
echo "   📝 Open $FRONTEND_URL in browser"
echo "   📝 Look for provider selector dropdown"
echo "   📝 Test with different API keys:"
echo "      - Gemini API key"
echo "      - OpenAI API key (if supported)"
echo "      - Anthropic API key (if supported)"

echo
echo "🎯 BYOK VALIDATION SUMMARY"
echo "========================="
echo "✅ Frontend deployed and accessible"
echo "✅ Client-side architecture (Vercel)"
echo "✅ Multi-provider code implemented"
echo "🔄 Manual testing needed for BYOK flow"

echo
echo "🚀 NEXT STEPS:"
echo "   1. Test provider selector UI at $FRONTEND_URL"
echo "   2. Verify API key input works for each provider"
echo "   3. Confirm analysis works with different APIs"
echo "   4. If all providers work → Day 1 COMPLETE! 🎉"

echo
echo "💡 Quick test with your keys:"
echo "   - Open browser → $FRONTEND_URL"
echo "   - Switch provider → Test analysis"
echo "   - If it works → LAUNCH! 🚀"
